This repository contains all the model, data and code files used for the publication "A new semi-analytic model for Stern-layer polarization in pore throats" (D. Kreith et al., 2024), submitted to Geophysical Journal International.

The directory "surface_complexation" containts all files connected to the surface complexation part of the paper (section 2). The directory "polarization_edl" contains all files necessary to reproduce the results of the polarization model dealing with different structures of the electrical double layer (sections 4 and 5.1), while the directory "polarization_geometry" contains all files related to the geometrical study (section 5.2).
